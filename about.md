Hi, my name is Joey. I'm currently enrolled in the NCSU Master of Statistics degree program, with anticipated graduation in Spring of 2022. I'm also working full time as a biostatistician, where I analyze data from clinical trials and other research studies. This program has already given me the knowledge and practice to excel at my work, and I hope to gain more knowledge about Data Science and R from this course.

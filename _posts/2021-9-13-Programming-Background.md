## My Programming Background

I have had years of programming experience in SAS before I learned R.
What I like about R is that it is very flexible. For example, you can
easily store a column from a dataset as an object. In SAS, everything
works in blocks, most of which are Data Steps, and you canâ€™t really
store a column as an object. However, I like how SAS stores the data as
SAS datasets. It is much easier to read compared to R and it allows me
to visually check for any data anomalies. All in all, I consider R to be
an easy language to learn and is more intuitive compared to SAS.

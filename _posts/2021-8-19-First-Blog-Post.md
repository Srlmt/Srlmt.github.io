## What is a Data Scientist?

I believe being a data scientist is about applying statistical knowledge and programming expertise to extract information from data and solve business problems. I see it as an "advanced" data analyst with skills from the statistics and computer science domains. 

## Duties and Knowledge Areas

I think the main goal as data scienstists is to extract value from data, which could include gaining insight or solving business problems. To acheive that, they would first need to understand business need and ask the right questions. Then, they can proceed to extract data, clean and process data, construct and try to find the best model, then present the results.  


## Data Scientists vs Statisticians

I believe there are two main differences between the two roles:

* Even though both roles deal with data to extract information, data scientists could work with big data (> 1TB). Statisticians often work with data from experiments, studies, or surveys, which would be much smaller. 
* 
* While both roles apply statistics, the approach is different. Statisticians involved in research often have to specify the statistical methods prior to processing the data, while data scientists use more data-driven approach where they train and test the model to try to find the best one.

## My View

I currently work as a biostatistician, so I have a better understanding of what it is like to be a statistician. I'm eager to learn more about data science from this course.
